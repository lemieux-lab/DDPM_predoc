# PoissonJUMP-DDPM-RNA

An implementation of a Poisson-JUMP DDPM inspired by (Chen \& Zhou, 2023) to denoise low-coverage RNA-seq data.

For julia version 1.10.3

## Usage

If you wish to use this code, it is recommended to open a Julia REPL in VScode in order to execute the functions and call them.

This code is still very much in developpement and unoptimized, but suggestions are appreciated!
